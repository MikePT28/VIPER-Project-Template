 This enum represent a Error without cases.

/**
 This enum represents the result of a execution for the `BaseWorker`
 
 The result can be:
 - success(let R): if the execution of the worker finished successfully. R is linked to the `BaseWorker` R result
 - failure(let E): if the execution of the worker finished with an error. E is linked to the `BaseWorker` E error

/**
 This class represents a unit of work.
 
 This class is typed with generics to avoid type casts while passing params and returning results or errors, in the next description
 there are a briefly description of each generic:
 - I: input type received as param while the worker is going to be executed
 - R: result that the worker is going to submit if the execution is succesfully completed
 - E: error that the worker is going to submit if the execution isn't succesfully completed
 
 This unit of work should only be invoked through one of its execute() methods:
 
 - using callbacks
 ```
 final func execute(input: I? = nil, completion: @escaping ((WorkerResult<R, E>) -> Void))
 ```
 
 Samples:
 
 ```
 enum ReverseError:Error{
 case empty
 }
 
 class ReverseWorker: BaseWorker<String,String,ReverseError> {
 override func job(input: String?, completion: @escaping ((WorkerResult<String, ReverseError>) -> Void)) {
 if let target = input {
 if target.isEmpty {
 completion(WorkerResult.failure(.empty))
 }else {
 completion(WorkerResult.success(String(target.reversed())))
 }
 }else {
 completion(WorkerResult.failure(.empty))
 }
 }
 }
 ```
 
 - using callbacks
 ```
 func callbackWay() {
 let reverse = ReverseWorker()
 reverse.execute { (locationResult) in
 switch locationResult {
 case .success(let reversed):
 print("result: \(reversed)")
 case .failure(let error):
 print("error: \(error)")
 }
 }
 }
 
 ```
